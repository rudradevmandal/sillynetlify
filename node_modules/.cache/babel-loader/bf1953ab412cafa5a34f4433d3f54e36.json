This means that the force will be distributed over the area of the thinly, but strongly, made strap. As the area of the strip is small, this concentrates the whole, heavy, weight of the bag on such a small area which makes it very difficult to carry.\r\n`;\r\n\r\nconst Q8 = `\r\nPage 141: What do you mean by buoyancy?\r\n`;\r\nconst QA8 = `\r\nWhen an object is immeresed in a fluid, it experiences a force which always opposes gravity.

The weight of the displaced air is far more greater than the air displaced by the iron bar.
