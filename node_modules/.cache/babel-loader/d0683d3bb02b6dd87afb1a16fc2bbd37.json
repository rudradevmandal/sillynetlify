Can you say which one is heavier and why?\r\n`;\r\nconst QA11 = `\r\nThe bag of cotton is heavier because it has larger volume hence, displaces larger amount of air than the iron bar. The weight of the displaced air is far more greater than the air displaced by the iron bar. This means that the upward force experienced by the cotton bag is more and hence if we add this to the reading of the weighing machine, we get the actual mass which is greater than the iron bar.\r\n`;\r\n\r\nconst InTextQnAContent = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Section>\r\n      <ExampleSection>\r\n        <QnAContainer>\r\n          <QnA srno={\"1\"} question={Q1} answer={QA1} />\r\n          <QnA srno={\"2\"} question={Q2} answer={QA2} />\r\n          <QnA srno={\"3\"} question={Q3} answer={QA3} />\r\n          <QnA srno={\"4\"} question={Q4} answer={QA4} />\r\n          <QnA srno={\"5\"} question={Q5} answer={QA5} />\r\n          <QnA srno={\"6\"} question={Q6} answer={QA6} />\r\n          <QnA srno={\"7\"} question={Q7} answer={QA7} />\r\n          <QnA srno={\"8\"} question={Q8} answer={QA8} />\r\n          <QnA srno={\"9\"} question={Q9} answer={QA9} />\r\n          <QnA srno={\"10\"} question={Q10} answer={QA10} />\r\n          <QnA srno={\"11\"} question={Q11} answer={QA11} />\r\n        </QnAContainer>\r\n      </ExampleSection>\r\n    </Section>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default InTextQnAContent"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AAEA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,mBAAnB;AACA,OAAOC,GAAP,MAAgB,WAAhB;;AAEA,MAAMC,OAAO,GAAGF,MAAM,CAACG,OAAQ;AAC/B;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,CANA;KAAMD,O;AAON,MAAME,cAAc,GAAGJ,MAAM,CAACG,OAAQ;AACtC;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,CANA;MAAMC,c;AAON,MAAMC,YAAY,GAAGL,MAAM,CAACM,GAAI;AAChC;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,CAXA;MAAMD,Y;AAaN,MAAME,EAAE,GAAI;AACZ;AACA,CAFA;AAGA,MAAMC,GAAG,GAAI;AACb;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,CAVA;AAYA,MAAMC,EAAE,GAAI;AACZ;AACA,CAFA;AAGA,MAAMC,GAAG,GAAI;AACb;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,CANA;AAQA,MAAMC,EAAE,GAAI;AACZ;AACA,CAFA;AAGA,MAAMC,GAAG,GAAI;AACb;AACA,CAFA;AAIA,MAAMC,EAAE,GAAI;AACZ;AACA,CAFA;AAGA,MAAMC,GAAG,GAAI;AACb;AACA,CAFA;AAIA,MAAMC,EAAE,GAAI;AACZ;AACA,CAFA;AAGA,MAAMC,GAAG,GAAI;AACb;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,CA/BA;AAiCA,MAAMC,EAAE,GAAI;AACZ;AACA,CAFA;AAGA,MAAMC,GAAG,GAAI;AACb;AACA,CAFA;AAIA,MAAMC,EAAE,GAAI;AACZ;AACA,CAFA;AAGA,MAAMC,GAAG,GAAI;AACb;AACA,CAFA;AAIA,MAAMC,EAAE,GAAI;AACZ;AACA,CAFA;AAGA,MAAMC,GAAG,GAAI;AACb;AACA,CAFA;AAIA,MAAMC,EAAE,GAAI;AACZ;AACA,CAFA;AAGA,MAAMC,GAAG,GAAI;AACb;AACA,CAFA;AAIA,MAAMC,GAAG,GAAI;AACb;AACA,CAFA;AAGA,MAAMC,IAAI,GAAI;AACd;AACA,CAFA;AAIA,MAAMC,GAAG,GAAI;AACb;AACA,CAFA;AAGA,MAAMC,IAAI,GAAI;AACd;AACA,CAFA;;AAIA,MAAMC,gBAAgB,GAAG,MAAM;EAC7B,oBACE,QAAC,OAAD;IAAA,uBACE,QAAC,cAAD;MAAA,uBACE,QAAC,YAAD;QAAA,wBACE,QAAC,GAAD;UAAK,IAAI,EAAE,GAAX;UAAgB,QAAQ,EAAEtB,EAA1B;UAA8B,MAAM,EAAEC;QAAtC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QADF,eAEE,QAAC,GAAD;UAAK,IAAI,EAAE,GAAX;UAAgB,QAAQ,EAAEC,EAA1B;UAA8B,MAAM,EAAEC;QAAtC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAFF,eAGE,QAAC,GAAD;UAAK,IAAI,EAAE,GAAX;UAAgB,QAAQ,EAAEC,EAA1B;UAA8B,MAAM,EAAEC;QAAtC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAHF,eAIE,QAAC,GAAD;UAAK,IAAI,EAAE,GAAX;UAAgB,QAAQ,EAAEC,EAA1B;UAA8B,MAAM,EAAEC;QAAtC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAJF,eAKE,QAAC,GAAD;UAAK,IAAI,EAAE,GAAX;UAAgB,QAAQ,EAAEC,EAA1B;UAA8B,MAAM,EAAEC;QAAtC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QALF,eAME,QAAC,GAAD;UAAK,IAAI,EAAE,GAAX;UAAgB,QAAQ,EAAEC,EAA1B;UAA8B,MAAM,EAAEC;QAAtC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QANF,eAOE,QAAC,GAAD;UAAK,IAAI,EAAE,GAAX;UAAgB,QAAQ,EAAEC,EAA1B;UAA8B,MAAM,EAAEC;QAAtC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAPF,eAQE,QAAC,GAAD;UAAK,IAAI,EAAE,GAAX;UAAgB,QAAQ,EAAEC,EAA1B;UAA8B,MAAM,EAAEC;QAAtC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QARF,eASE,QAAC,GAAD;UAAK,IAAI,EAAE,GAAX;UAAgB,QAAQ,EAAEC,EAA1B;UAA8B,MAAM,EAAEC;QAAtC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QATF,eAUE,QAAC,GAAD;UAAK,IAAI,EAAE,IAAX;UAAiB,QAAQ,EAAEC,GAA3B;UAAgC,MAAM,EAAEC;QAAxC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAVF,eAWE,QAAC,GAAD;UAAK,IAAI,EAAE,IAAX;UAAiB,QAAQ,EAAEC,GAA3B;UAAgC,MAAM,EAAEC;QAAxC;UAAA;UAAA;UAAA;QAAA,QAXF;MAAA;QAAA;QAAA;QAAA;MAAA;IADF;MAAA;MAAA;MAAA;IAAA;EADF;IAAA;IAAA;IAAA;EAAA,QADF;AAmBD,CApBD;;MAAMC,gB;AAsBN,eAAeA,gBAAf"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
